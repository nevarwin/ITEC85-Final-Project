              <h3 id="1">What is cryptography?</h3>
              <p>
                As a child, you may recall using symbols to write coded messages
                to your classmates that no one else could understand. More
                seriously, codes and ciphers are used for information security
                in computer systems and networks to protect sensitive and
                commercial information from unauthorized access when it is at
                rest or in transit. Uses include anything from keeping military
                secrets to transmitting financial data safely across the
                Internet.
                <br />
                <br />
                Cryptography is an important computer security tool that deals
                with techniques to store and transmit information in ways that
                prevent unauthorized access or interference.

                How cryptography keeps communication secret and safe
              </h3>
              <p>
                The cryptographic process of scrambling text from a readable
                form to an unintelligible form – known as cipher text – is
                called encryption. Sending secret or private messages as cipher
                text is a typical use of cryptography. Once the cipher text is
                received, it is descrambled by the authorized recipient back to
                its readable form. The descrambling (or decryption) is performed
                with the use of an encryption key, which serves to prevent third
                parties from reading these messages.
                <br /><br />

                Encryption methods have been used by many civilizations
                throughout history to prevent non-authorized people from
                understanding messages. Julius Caesar is credited for one of the
                earliest forms of cipher – the “Caesar Cipher” – to convey
                messages to his generals. With increasing sophistication,
                cryptography now plays a vital role in ensuring the privacy,
                data confidentiality, data integrity and authentication in
                computer systems and networks. In today’s world, where the
                majority of our personal and professional communications and
                transactions are conducted online, cryptography is more
                important than ever.
              </p>

              <!-- Common information security threats -->
              <h3 id="3">Types of cryptography systems</h3>
              <p>
                Cryptography refers to the techniques and algorithms that are
                used today for secure communication and data in storage. It
                incorporates mathematics, computer science, electronics and
                digital signal processing. Broadly speaking, there are four
                types of cryptography systems:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Symmetric-key cryptography (or “secret key”):</strong
                    >
                    In this type of system, both the sender and the receiver
                    share the same key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the
                    message.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Asymmetric-key cryptography (or “public key”):</strong
                    >
                    In this type of cryptography system, there are two keys –
                    one public and one private; these form a pair and are
                    related mathematically. To apply asymmetric cryptography,
                    the sender uses the public key of the intended recipient to
                    encode the message, and then sends it on its way. When the
                    message arrives, only the recipient’s private key can be
                    used to decode it, meaning that a stolen message is of no
                    use to the thief without the corresponding private key.
                    Encryption mechanisms are the focus of ISO/IEC 18033, a
                    suite of International Standards that specifies a number of
                    asymmetric ciphers. The multipart series includes
                    identity-based ciphers, block ciphers, stream ciphers, and
                    homomorphic encryption.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Cryptographic key management:</strong> This type of
                    system is crucial for protecting the keys used in both
                    symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. It includes a set of
                    processes covering the entire “life cycle” of a key,
                    including its generation, exchange and distribution,
                    storage, use, safe destruction and replacement. If the key
                    management is weak, then the protection of encrypted data is
                    weak. There are a number of International Standards relating
                    to key management (e.g. ISO/IEC 11770) and key generation
                    (e.g. ISO/IEC 18031 and ISO/IEC 18032).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Cryptographic hash function:</strong> This is a
                    technique that converts a string of data of any length into
                    a hashed output (a digest of the input) of fixed length.
                    Hash functions have many applications such as in digital
                    signatures, MACs (message authentication codes), and
                    checksums (to check data corruption). International
                    Standards that specify hash functions include ISO/IEC
                    9797-2, ISO/IEC 9797-3 and ISO/IEC 10118.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <!-- Information security principles and uses of cryptography  -->
              <h3 id="4">
                Information security principles and uses of cryptography
              </h3>
              <p>
                The key principles of information security are confidentiality,
                integrity and availability. Cryptography is an important tool
                that helps to preserve two of these principles:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Data confidentiality ensures that data is not disclosed to
                    unauthorized parties. Cryptographic techniques such as
                    encryption can be used to protect the confidentiality of
                    data by making it unreadable to those who don’t have the
                    proper decryption key.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Data integrity ensures that data has not been modified or
                    corrupted. One example for International Standards on data
                    integrity is ISO/IEC 9797, which specifies algorithms for
                    calculating message authentication codes.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition to these key information security objectives,
                cryptography is used to achieve:
              </p>
              <h4>Entity authentication</h4>
              <p>
                By checking knowledge of a secret, entity authentication
                verifies the identity of the sender. Various crypto-based
                mechanisms and protocols can be used to achieve this, such as
                symmetric systems, digital signatures, zero-knowledge techniques
                and checksums. ISO/IEC 9798 is a series of standards that
                specifies entity authentication protocols and techniques.
              </p>
              <h4>Digital signatures</h4>
              <p>
                Used to verify the authenticity of data, digital signatures
                confirm that the data originated from the signer and has not
                been changed. They are used, for example, in email messages,
                electronic documents and online payments. International
                Standards that specify digital signature schemes include ISO/IEC
                9796, ISO/IEC 14888, ISO/IEC 18370 and ISO/IEC 20008.
              </p>
              <h4>Non-repudiation</h4>
              <p>
                Cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures can be used
                to provide non-repudiation by ensuring that the sender and
                receiver of a message cannot deny that they, respectively, sent
                or received the message. The standard ISO/IEC 13888 describes
                techniques (symmetric and asymmetric) for the provision of
                non-repudiation services.
              </p>
              <h4>Lightweight cryptography</h4>
              <p>
                Lightweight cryptography is used in applications and
                technologies that are constrained in computational complexity:
                limiting factors can be memory, power and computing resources.
                The need for lightweight cryptography is expanding in our modern
                digital world. Constrained devices – for example IoT (Internet
                of Things) sensors or actuators like the ones switching on
                appliances in a so-called smart home – use lightweight symmetric
                cryptography. ISO/IEC 29192 is an eight-part standard that
                specifies various cryptographic techniques for lightweight
                applications.
              </p>
              <h4>Digital rights management</h4>
              <p>
                Digital rights management (DRM) protects the copyright of your
                digital content. DRM uses cryptographic software to ensure that
                only authorized users can have access to the material, modify or
                distribute it.
              </p>
              <h4>Electronic commerce and online shopping</h4>
              <p>
                Secure e-commerce is made possible by the use of asymmetric-key
                encryption. Cryptography plays an important role in online
                shopping as it protects credit card information and related
                personal details, as well as customers’ purchasing history and
                transactions.

              <h4>Cryptocurrencies and blockchain</h4>
              <p>
                A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptographic
                techniques to secure transactions. Each cryptocurrency coin is
                validated via distributed ledger technologies (e.g. blockchain).
                A ledger, in this case, is a continuously growing list of
                records – known as blocks – that are linked together using

              <h3 id="5">What are cryptographic algorithms?</h3>
              <p>
                A cryptographic algorithm is a math-based process for encoding
                text and making it unreadable. Cryptographic algorithms are used
                to provide data confidentiality, data integrity and
                authentication, as well as for digital signatures and other
                security purposes.
                <br /><br />
                Both DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption
                Standard) are popular examples of symmetric-key algorithms,
                while prominent asymmetric-key algorithms include RSA
                (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (elliptic curve cryptography).
              </p>
              <h4>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)</h4>
              <p>
                ECC is an asymmetric-key technique based on the use of elliptic
                curves, which has applications in encryption and digital
                signatures, for example. ECC technology can be used to create
                faster, smaller and more efficient cryptographic keys. Elliptic
                curve techniques are covered in the multipart standard ISO/IEC
                15946.
              </p>
              <h4>Standards for cryptography</h4>
              <p>
                Cryptography has been the subject of intense standardization
                efforts resulting in a range of International Standards that
                encapsulate the knowledge and best practice of leading experts
                in the field. Internationally agreed ways of working make
                technology more secure and interoperable. By using cryptography
                standards, developers can rely on common definitions, as well as
                proven methods and techniques.
              </p>
              <h4>Future-proofing cryptography</h4>
              <p>
                Today, we are on the edge of a quantum revolution. The advent of
                quantum computing in the coming years will provide mankind with
                processing powers on a scale that traditional computers can
                never hope to match. While this offers countless possibilities
                for complex problem-solving, it also comes with corresponding
                security threats. That very same power could undermine much of
                today’s cybersecurity – including established cryptographic
                practices.
                <br /><br />
                Quantum cryptography is a method of encryption that applies the
                principles of quantum mechanics to provide secure communication.
                It uses quantum entanglement to generate a secret key to encrypt
                a message in two separate places, making it (almost) impossible
                for an eavesdropper to intercept without altering its contents.
                Hailed as the next big revolution in secure communication
                systems, quantum cryptography has the potential to be a real
                breakthrough for data that needs to stay private far into the
                future.
                <br /><br />
                The new dawn of encryption is looking bright!
