              <h3 id="1">What is Web Application Security?</h3>
              <p>
                Web application security is the practice of protecting websites,
                applications, and APIs from attacks. It is a broad discipline,
                but its ultimate aims are keeping web applications functioning
                smoothly and protecting business from cyber vandalism, data
                theft, unethical competition, and other negative consequences.
                <br />
                <br />
                The global nature of the Internet exposes web applications and
                APIs to attacks from many locations and various levels of scale
                and complexity. As such, web application security encompasses a
                variety of strategies and covers many parts of the software
                supply chain.
              </p>

              <!-- 2nd Section -->
              <h3 id="2">What are common web application security risks?</h3>
              <p>
                Web applications may face a number of attack types depending on
                the attacker’s goals, the nature of the targeted organization’s
                work, and the application’s particular security gaps. Common
                attack types include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Zero-day vulnerabilities:</strong>These are
                    vulnerabilities unknown to an application’s makers, and
                    which thus do not have a fix available. We now see more than
                    20,000 every year. Attacks look to exploit these
                    vulnerabilities quickly, and often follow up by seeking to
                    evade protections put in place by security vendors.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Cross site scripting (XSS):</strong> XSS is a
                    vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject client-side
                    scripts into a webpage in order to access important
                    information directly, impersonate the user, or trick the
                    user into revealing important information.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SQL injection (SQi):</strong> SQi is a method by
                    which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the way a
                    database executes search queries. Attackers use SQi to gain
                    access to unauthorized information, modify or create new
                    user permissions, or otherwise manipulate or destroy
                    sensitive data.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Denial-of-service (DoS)</strong> and distributed
                    denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: Through a variety of
                    vectors, attackers are able to overload a targeted server or
                    its surrounding infrastructure with different types of
                    attack traffic. When a server is no longer able to
                    effectively process incoming requests, it begins to behave
                    sluggishly and eventually deny service to incoming requests
                    from legitimate users.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Memory corruption:</strong> Memory corruption occurs
                    when a location in memory is unintentionally modified,
                    resulting in the potential for unexpected behavior in the
                    software. Bad actors will attempt to sniff out and exploit
                    memory corruption through exploits such as code injections
                    or buffer overflow attacks.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Buffer overflow:</strong> Buffer overflow is an
                    anomaly that occurs when software writing data to a defined
                    space in memory known as a buffer. Overflowing the buffer’s
                    capacity results in adjacent memory locations being
                    overwritten with data. This behavior can be exploited to
                    inject malicious code into memory, potentially creating a
                    vulnerability in the targeted machine.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):</strong> Cross
                    site request forgery involves tricking a victim into making
                    a request that utilizes their authentication or
                    authorization. By leveraging the account privileges of a
                    user, an attacker is able to send a request masquerading as
                    the user. Once a user’s account has been compromised, the
                    attacker can exfiltrate, destroy or modify important
                    information. Highly privileged accounts such as
                    administrators or executives are commonly targeted.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Credential stuffing:</strong>Attackers may use bots
                    to quickly input large numbers of stolen username and
                    password combinations into a web application’s login portal.
                    If this practice gives the attacker access to a real user’s
                    account, they may steal the user’s data or make fraudulent
                    purchases in the user’s name.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Page scraping:</strong>Attackers may also use bots
                    to steal content from webpages on a large scale. They may
                    use this content to gain a pricing advantage over a
                    competitor, imitate the page owner for malicious purposes,
                    or other reasons.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>API abuse:</strong> APIs, or Application Programming
                    Interfaces, are software that allow two applications to
                    communicate with each other. Like any type of software, they
                    may have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to send
                    malicious code into one of the applications or intercept
                    sensitive data as it moves from one application to another.
                    This is an increasingly common attack type as API use
                    increases. The OWASP API Top ten list succinctly summarized
                    key API security risks organizations face today.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Shadow APIs:</strong> Development teams work quickly
                    to meet business objectives, frequently building and
                    publishing APIs without informing security teams. These
                    unknown APIs may expose sensitive company data, operating in
                    the “shadows” as security teams tasked with protecting APIs
                    are unaware of their existence.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Third-party code abuse:</strong> Many modern web
                    applications use a variety of third-party tools — for
                    example, an ecommerce site using a third-party payment
                    processing tool. If attackers find a vulnerability in one of
                    these tools, they may be able to compromise the tool, and
                    steal the data it processes, prevent it from functioning, or
                    use it to inject malicious code elsewhere in the
                    application. Magecart attacks, which skim credit card data
                    from payment processors, are an example of this attack type.
                    These attacks are also considered to be browser supply chain
                    attacks.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Attack surface misconfigurations:</strong> An
                    organization’s attack surface is its entire IT footprint
                    that could be susceptible to cyberattacks: servers, devices,
                    SaaS, and cloud assets that are accessible from the
                    Internet. This attack surface can remain vulnerable to
                    attack due to certain elements being overlooked or
                    misconfigured.

                What are important web application security strategies?
              </h3>
              <p>
                As mentioned, web application security is a broad,
                always-changing discipline. As such, the discipline’s best
                practices change as new attacks and vulnerabilities emerge. But
                the modern Internet threat landscape is active enough that no
                organization will be able to get by without certain ‘table
                stakes’ security services that map to their business’ specific
                needs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DDoS mitigation:</strong> DDoS mitigation services
                    sit between a server and the public Internet, using
                    specialized filtration and extremely high bandwidth capacity
                    to prevent surges of malicious traffic from overwhelming the
                    server. These services are important because many modern
                    DDoS attacks deliver enough malicious traffic to overwhelm
                    even the most resilient servers.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF):</strong> WAFs filter
                    out traffic known or suspected to be taking advantage of web
                    application vulnerabilities. They are important because new
                    vulnerabilities emerge too quickly and quietly for nearly
                    all organizations to catch on their own.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>API gateways:</strong> API gateways help identify
                    overlooked 'shadow APIs' and block traffic known or
                    suspected to target API vulnerabilities. They also help
                    manage and monitor API traffic.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DNSSEC:</strong> DNSSEC is a protocol that
                    guarantees a web application's DNS traffic is safely routed

                    <strong>Encryption certificate management:</strong> In
                    encryption certificate management, a third party manages key
                    elements of the SSL/TLS encryption process, such as
                    generating private keys, renewing certificates, and revoking
                    certificates due to vulnerabilities. This removes the risk
                    of those elements going overlooked and exposing private
                    traffic.

                What application security best practices should organizations
                expect from their vendors?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Web developers can design and build applications in ways that
                prevent attackers from accessing private data, fraudulently
                accessing user accounts, and performing other malicious actions.
                The OWASP Top 10 list captures the most common application
                security risks developers should be aware of. Practices to
                prevent these risks include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Requiring input validation:</strong> Blocking
                    improperly formatted data from passing through the
                    application's workflows helps prevent malicious code from
                    entering the application via an injection attack.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Using up-to-date encryption:</strong> Storing user
                    data in an encrypted fashion, along with using HTTPS to
                    encrypt transmission of inbound and outbound traffic, helps
                    prevent attackers from stealing data.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong
                      >Offering strong authentication and authorization:</strong
                    >
                    Building in and enforcing controls for strong passwords,
                    offering multi-factor authentication options including hard
                    keys, offering access control options, and other practices
                    make it harder for attackers to fraudulently access user
                    accounts and move laterally within your application.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Keeping track of APIs:</strong> Tools exist to
                    identify overlooked 'shadow APIs' that could constitute an
                    attack surface, but API security becomes easier when APIs
                    never get overlooked in the first place.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Documenting code changes:</strong> Documenting code
                    changes helps security and developer teams fix newly
                    introduced vulnerabilities sooner.
                  </p>
