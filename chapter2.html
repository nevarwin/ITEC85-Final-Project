              <h3 id="1">What is network security?</h3>
              <p>
                Network security is the field of cybersecurity focused on
                protecting computer networks from cyber threats. Network
                security has three chief aims: to prevent unauthorized access to
                network resources; to detect and stop cyberattacks and security
                breaches in progress; and to ensure that authorized users have
                secure access to the network resources they need, when they need
                them.
              </p>

              <!-- 2nd Section -->
              <h3 id="2">Types of network security technologies</h3>
              <p>
                Network security systems work at two levels: at the perimeter
                and inside the network. <br /><br />
                At the perimeter, security controls try to stop cyberthreats
                from entering the network. But network attackers sometimes break
                through, so IT security teams also put controls around the
                resources inside the network, like laptops and data. Even if
                attackers get in, they won't have free reign. This
                strategy—layering multiple controls between hackers and
                potential vulnerabilities—is called "defense in depth."
                <br /><br />
                To build network security systems, security teams combine the
                following tools:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Firewalls</strong>
                  <p>
                    A firewall is software or hardware that stops suspicious
                    traffic from entering or leaving a network while letting
                    legitimate traffic through. Firewalls can be deployed at the
                    edges of a network or used internally to divide a larger
                    network into smaller subnetworks. If one part of the network
                    is compromised, hackers are still shut off from the rest.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are different types of firewalls with different
                    features. Basic firewalls use packet filtering to inspect
                    traffic. More advanced next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) add
                    intrusion prevention, AI and machine learning, application
                    awareness and control, and threat intelligence feeds for
                    extra protection.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Network access control (NAC)</strong>
                  <p>
                    Network access control (NAC) solutions act like gatekeepers,
                    authenticating and authorizing users to determine who is
                    allowed into the network and what they can do inside.
                    "Authentication" means verifying that a user is who they
                    claim to be. "Authorization" means granting authenticated
                    users permission to access network resources.
                    <br /><br />
                    NAC solutions are often used to enforce role-based access
                    control (RBAC) policies, in which users' privileges are
                    based on their job functions. For example, a junior
                    developer might be able to view and edit code but not push
                    it live. In contrast, senior developers could read, write,
                    and push code to production. RBAC helps prevent data
                    breaches by keeping unauthorized users away from assets they
                    are not permitted to access.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to authenticating users, some NAC solutions can
                    do risk assessments on users' endpoints. The goal is to keep
                    unsecured or compromised devices from accessing the network.
                    If a user tries to enter the network on a device with
                    outdated anti-malware software or incorrect configurations,
                    the NAC will deny access. Some advanced NAC tools can
                    automatically fix non-compliant endpoints.

                    An intrusion detection and prevention system
                    (IDPS)—sometimes called an intrusion prevention system
                    (IPS)—can be deployed directly behind a firewall to scan
                    incoming traffic for security threats. These security tools
                    evolved from intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which only
                    flagged suspicious activity for review. IDPSs have the added
                    ability to automatically respond to possible breaches, such
                    as by blocking traffic or resetting the connection. IDPSs
                    are particularly effective at detecting and blocking brute
                    force attacks and denial of service (DoS) or distributed
                    denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Virtual private networks (VPNs)</strong>
                  <p>
                    A virtual private network (VPN) protects a user's identity
                    by encrypting their data and masking their IP address and
                    location. When someone uses a VPN, they no longer connect
                    directly to the internet but to a secure server that
                    connects to the internet on their behalf.
                    <br /><br />
                    VPNs can help remote workers securely access corporate
                    networks, even through unsecured public wifi connections
                    like those found in coffee shops and airports. VPNs encrypt
                    a user's traffic, keeping it safe from hackers who might
                    want to intercept their communications.
                    <br /><br />
                    Instead of VPNs, some organizations use zero trust network
                    access (ZTNA). Rather than using a proxy server, ZTNA uses
                    zero-trust access control policies to securely connect
                    remote users. When remote users log into a network through
                    ZTNA, they don't gain access to the whole network. Instead,
                    they only gain access to the specific assets they're
                    permitted to use, and they must be reverified every time
                    they access a new resource. See 'A zero trust approach to
                    network security' below for a closer look at how zero trust
                    security works.

                  <strong>Application security</strong>
                  <p>
                    Application security refers to the steps security teams take
                    to protect apps and application programming interfaces
                    (APIs) from network attackers. Because many companies today
                    use apps to carry out key business functions or process
                    sensitive data, apps are a common target for cybercriminals.
                    And because so many business apps are hosted in public
                    clouds, hackers can exploit their vulnerabilities to break
                    into private company networks.
                    <br /><br />

                    Application security measures defend apps from malicious
                    actors. Common application security tools include web
                    application firewalls (WAFs), runtime application
                    self-protection (RASP), static application security testing
                    (SAST), and dynamic application security testing (DAST).

                  <strong>Email security</strong>
                  <p>
                    The IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found
                    that phishing is the most common initial cyberattack vector.
                    Email security tools can help thwart phishing attacks and
                    other attempts to compromise users' email accounts. Most
                    email services have built-in security tools like spam
                    filters and message encryption. Some email security tools
                    feature sandboxes, isolated environments where security
                    teams can inspect email attachments for malware without
                    exposing the network.

                While the following tools are not strictly network security
                tools, network administrators often use them to protect areas
                and assets on a network.

                  <p>
                    refers to information security strategies and tools that
                    ensure sensitive data is neither stolen nor accidentally
                    leaked. DLP includes data security policies and
                    purpose-built technologies that track data flows, encrypt
                    sensitive information, and raise alerts when suspicious

                  <strong>Endpoint security solutions</strong>
                  <p>
                    protect any devices that connect to a network—laptops,
                    desktops, servers, mobile devices, IoT devices—against
                    hackers who try to use them to sneak into the network.
                    Antivirus software can detect and destroy trojans, spyware,
                    and other malicious software on a device before it spreads
                    to the rest of the network. Endpoint detection and response
                    (EDR) solutions are more advanced tools that monitor
                    endpoint behavior and automatically respond to security
                    events. Unified endpoint management (UEM) software allows
                    companies to monitor, manage, and secure all end-user
                    devices from a single console.

                  <strong> Network segmentation </strong>
                  <p>
                    is a way of breaking large networks down into smaller
                    subnetworks, either physically or through software. Network
                    segmentation can limit the spread of ransomware and other

                    solutions protect data centers, apps, and other cloud assets
                    from cyberattacks. Most cloud security solutions are simply
                    standard network security measures—like firewalls, NACs, and
                    VPNs— applied to cloud environments. Many cloud service
                    providers build security controls into their services or
                    offer them as add-ons.

              <h3 id="4">A zero trust approach to network security</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Traditional company networks were centralized, with key
                    endpoints, data, and apps located on premises. Traditional
                    network security systems focused on keeping threats from
                    breaching the network's perimeter. Once a user got in, they
                    were treated as trustworthy and granted practically
                    unrestricted access.
                    <br /><br />
                    However, as organizations pursue digital transformation and
                    adopt hybrid cloud environments, networks are becoming
                    decentralized. Now, network resources exist across cloud
                    data centers, on-site and remote endpoints, and mobile and
                    IoT devices.
                    <br /><br />
                    Perimeter-based security controls are less effective in
                    distributed networks, so many IT security teams are shifting
                    to zero-trust network security frameworks. Instead of
                    focusing on the perimeter, zero-trust network security
                    places security controls around individual resources. Users
                    are never implicitly trusted. Every time a user tries to
                    access a resource, they must be authenticated and
                    authorized, regardless of whether they're already on the
                    company network. Authenticated users are granted
                    least-privilege access only, and their permissions are
                    revoked as soon as their task is done.
                    <br /><br />
                    Zero trust network security relies on granular access
                    policies, continuous validation, and data gathered from as
                    many sources as possible — including many of the tools
                    outlined above — to ensure that only the right users can
                    access the right resources for the right reasons at the
                    right time.

                While a defense-in-depth approach can protect a company's
                network, it also means the IT security team has to manage a
                number of separate security controls. Enterprise network
                security platforms can help streamline network security
                management by integrating disparate security tools and allowing
                security teams to monitor the whole network from a single
                console. Common network security platforms include:

                  seamlessly on threat prevention, detection, investigation and
